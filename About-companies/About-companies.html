            <h2>How Jobster Helps Companies</h2>
            <p>Jobster is a modern recruitment platform designed to streamline the hiring process for companies. Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Post Job Listings:</strong> Companies can easily post job openings to attract potential candidates.</li>
                <li><strong>Swipe Right Feature:</strong> Candidates browse jobs on their phone and swipe right if interested. This creates a fast, intuitive connection with potential hires.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Interest:</strong> When a company swipes right on a candidate's profile, a match is made.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Introduction:</strong> Upon matching, candidates are automatically prompted to record a 60-second video explaining why they are a great fit for the role.</li>
                <li><strong>Review and Proceed:</strong> Companies receive the video and can decide whether to move forward with a call screening or continue the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Streamlined Matching:</strong> Once a match is confirmed, the hiring process moves off the app, and Jobster's role is complete, leaving you to finalize the hiring.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Jobster simplifies the early stages of recruitment, saving time and allowing you to focus on finding the right talent quickly and efficiently.</p>
